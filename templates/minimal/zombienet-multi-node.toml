# Nodes might alternate in block production for a while, based on
# the manual-seal timer, if rightly set to allow enough time for
# nodes to produce and propose nodes, and then wait for peers to do
# the same. The same nodes follow with importing the proposed blocks,
# increasing the fork height with blocks not produced by them. If nodes
# overlap for the block production at a certain height, they'll stop
# being peers and will follow with block production for their own
# initiated forks.
